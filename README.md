	    Version 0.1 ALPHA



## Dependencies
- https://github.com/Lillious/Lethal-Company-Mod-Library
- https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader **(Version 0.5.4)**

## General
Despite this game's growing popularity, a developer console has yet to be implemented. Lillious and .Zer0 have set out to create 
that exact thing - to not only be used for players but also for debugging use in-game for modders! We hope that in our endeavours,
we are able to create something that will become essential within the modding community and bring ease to everyone's experiences <3

## Installation
1. Please ensure that the appropriate dependencies have been downloaded and installed *(Refer to the beginning of the README for links)*.
2. Place the "Lethal_Library.dll" in the /Lethal Company/UserLibs folder in the game directory.
   - **IF YOU DO NOT SEE THE USERLIBS, MODS, OR PLUGINS FOLDER - RUN THE GAME WITH MELONLOADER INSTALLED. THE FOLDERS WILL THEN BE CREATED**
3. Place the "Non-Lethal Dev Console.dll" in /Lethal Company/Mods in the game directory.
4. Enjoy!
